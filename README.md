# RoboAI Cyberlab Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Tool Chatbot - Project Report

## Summary

This project was carried out at Satakunta University of Applied Sciences' **RoboAI Academy** with the goal of developing a chatbot to assist companies in understanding and complying with the revised **EU Information Security Directive** (NIS2). The chatbot leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) technology to provide accurate answers based on relevant NIS2 and related documentation.

The project involved testing various models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Claude (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), and LumiOpen for Finnish language support. The team faced challenges with accuracy, Finnish translations, and model efficiency. After six weeks of research, experimentation, and refinement, the chatbot was successfully developed along with an API to facilitate easy integration.

The KYTEE team expresses its sincere gratitude to **Yilin Wang and Shristi Bhandari** for their dedicated work and commitment in developing this chatbot. Their expertise, perseverance, and teamwork have resulted in a highly valuable tool that will greatly assist companies in navigating NIS2 compliance. Special thanks also go to **Toni Aaltonen** and **Juha Aalto** for their invaluable support in supervising the project.
